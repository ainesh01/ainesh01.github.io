# Welcome to My Profile Page (CSE 110 assignment)

I'm a second year computer engineering major at [UC San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/) and my interests are in programming as well as in finance. I aim to go into a role that ties both of these fields together, like fintech for example.

I've worked in internships in many different fields, from defense to manufacturing and cryptocurrency.
